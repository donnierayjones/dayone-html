# Quick and Dirty [Day One][1] HTML Export

I created this to export my Day One App entries into a format more
suited for printing to a book.

It runs on Ruby (Sinatra) and requires you store your posts in
Dropbox rather than iCloud.

It's not very flexible. You'll need to know your way around Ruby /
Sinatra to get it customized to your liking.
